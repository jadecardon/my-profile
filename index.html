						<h1>🌸WELCOME TO MY PROFILE!🌸</h1>
			    		<img src="images/photo-de-profil.jpeg" alt="pdp">
			    		<p>Hello! My name is Jade Cardon, I'm 18yo and I'm French. I have been living in Yerres, south-east of Paris, since I was born but I am currently living in Cergy, where I'm studying for a degree in Business Administration in ESSEC Business School! </p>

						<h2>🎶MUSIC🎶</h2>
						<p>
						I have been passionate about music since I was a little girl. I have been playing the piano since I was 7 years old and I took singing, music theory and piano lessons at the conservatory for 10 years. I am currently learning Chopin's Nocturne in C minor, op.48, No. 1.</p>
						<p>I also love listening to music at any time of the day. I usually listen to classical music when I'm working because it helps me concentrate and before I go to sleep because it relaxes me. I also listen to a lot of pop music with my friends when we are together.</p>

						<h2>✈️TRAVEL✈️</h2>
						<p>
							I love travelling, discovering new cultures, meeting new people,etc. When we travel, we have the possibility of learning a new language, a new cuisine, aspects of a different culture, or even acquiring a deeper appreciation of faith or spirituality. I love travelling with <strong>my family or with my friends.</strong> We can meet new people and we can exploring and enjoying beautiful landscapes and different environments.						
						</p>

						<h2>🥂FRIENDSHIP🥂</h2>
						<p>
							I have many friends but I also have a smaller circle. I have three friends at ESSEC who are very close to me and with whom I spend most of my days. I love being with them and they make me happy. I like spending time with them, going out to clubs and restaurants, going to classes and even when we are together doing nothing. They are important to me and they are my best meetings of the year. For me, <strong>friendship is a source of happiness</strong> and it is important to have friends to rely on in life.
